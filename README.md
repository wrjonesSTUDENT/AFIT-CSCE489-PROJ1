# Questions
1. Why was it necessary that your shell use the fork command before running the exec() system call (5 pts)?

2. Explain, in as much detail as possible, what happened when you called the fprintf function (10 pts)? Keep in mind, I'm looking for an answer that discusses the process from when the function is entered, through the different "layers" until the function is complete.
